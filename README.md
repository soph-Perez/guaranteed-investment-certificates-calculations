# Guaranteed Investment Certificates Calculation
Calculates total user cost based on whether or not they are buying oil or gas, how much number of oil cases or gas litres they are purchasing, and what province they are in.

## Requirements:
Write a program that asks the user to enter a GIC term in years and an amount to invest. Using the information in the table below, select the correct interest rate based upon term, calculate, and print the interest accumulated. As well as the total amount at the end of the term. Use a simple interest calculation and assume interest is not compounded annually.<br><br>
total interest = amount * interest rate * years invested<br><br>
Use constant variables to hold rates. Assume only valid data is entered as inputs.<br>
| Term (in Years) | Interest Rate (as Percentage) |
| :--- | :---: | 
| 1 | 4.9 | 
| 2 | 4.1 | 
| 3 | 4.0 | 
| 4 | 3.8 | 
| 5 | 3.75 | 

## Sample Run:
Sample runs: (inputs are underlined). Run your program 3 times to produce the following output)
Enter GIC Term: 3<br> 
Enter amount to invest: 10000<br> 
Interest at end of term = $1,200.00<br> 
Total at end of term = $11,200.00<br>
<br>
Enter GIC Term: 1<br> 
Enter amount to invest: 400<br> 
Interest at end of term = $19.60<br> 
Total at end of term = $419.60<br>
<br>
Enter GIC Term: 5<br> 
Enter amount to invest: 9999<br> 
Interest at end of term = $1,874.81<br>
Total at end of term = $11,873.81
